/*This unit test will check the following regarding each cache algorithm:
 * Get an existing key - its value needs to be returned
 * Get an non-existing key - null value needs to be returned
 * Put an element to a non-full cache - verify cache's values.
 * Put an element to a full cache - a page fault needs to be performed - check the key which is replaced depends on the Algorithm.
 * Remove a non-existing element from the cache - nothing happens and the currentSame should stay the same, the keys stay the same in the cache
 * Remove an existing element from the cache - currentSame needs to be decremented by 1 and the key must be removed from the cache
 * Check time complexity of each algorithm (necessary?)
